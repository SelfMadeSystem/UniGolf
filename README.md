# UniGolf

UniGolf is a golfing game based on the now defunct [MonoGolf](https://livito.win/downloads/Monogolf_base.apk). MonoGolf was a game where you had to get a ball into a hole in one shot. It had a campaign mode, a level editor, and community map packs. It was a great game, but it was removed from the Play Store in (I think) 2020. I decided to make a clone of it, and here it is.

I want to expand on the original game, so I'm adding new features. The game is open source, so anyone can contribute to it. I'm also making it cross-platform, so it can be played on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and the web. Currently, only Windows, Linux, Android and the web are supported because I don't have a Mac or an iPhone.

This game is made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), a free and open source game engine. It's written in GDScript, a language similar to Python.
